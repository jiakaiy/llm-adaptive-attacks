sft_severe_yhat.py

Build rewrites for *severe* prompts using the ENTIRE
sft_train_severe_original_prompts_excludeHard.jsonl, partitioned into
Phase A/B/C/D per the latest rules:

Inputs (expected):
  - sft_train_severe_original_prompts_excludeHard.jsonl   # base severe set (e.g., 995 prompts)
  - retry_catfact_results_input.jsonl                     # uses custom_id -> we normalize to index
  - retry_severe_phaseC_fish_input.jsonl                  # uses index
  - retry_severe_phaseD_175_input.jsonl                   # uses index

Outputs (created/overwritten):
  - retry_catfact_phaseB_unique_input.jsonl               # normalized+deduped (by prompt, keep lowest index)
  - retry_severe_phaseC_fish_unique_input.jsonl           # deduped (by prompt, keep lowest index)
  - retry_severe_phaseD_175_unique_input.jsonl            # deduped (by prompt, keep lowest index)
  - sft_severe_excludeHard_changedprompts.jsonl           # final combined with templates

Final record format:
  {"index": <int>, "original prompt": "...", "group": "sft_severe_phaseX_template", "output prompt": "..."}

Phase definitions (disjoint by construction):
  Let BASE be indices from sft_train_severe_original_prompts_excludeHard.jsonl
  Let CAT  be indices from retry_catfact_phaseB_unique_input.jsonl
  Let FISH be indices from retry_severe_phaseC_fish_unique_input.jsonl
  Let D175 be indices from retry_severe_phaseD_175_unique_input.jsonl
  Let BL   be the fixed blocklist set

  Phase A: (BASE \ CAT)
  Phase B: (CAT  \ FISH) ∩ BASE        # IMPORTANT: only keep those present in BASE
  Phase C: (FISH \ D175) ∩ BASE        # IMPORTANT: only keep those present in BASE
  Phase D: (D175 \ BL) ∩ BASE          # IMPORTANT: only keep those present in BASE

Coverage note:
  The union A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D may miss BASE indices that fall into CAT ∩ FISH ∩ D175 ∩ BL.
  Script prints coverage stats and a small sample of uncovered indices, if any.
