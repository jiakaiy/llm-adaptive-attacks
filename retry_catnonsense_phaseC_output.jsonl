Then introduce the addition operation recursively: for any natural number n, n + 0 = n and n + S(m) = S(n + m), where S denotes the successor function.  \n\nStep 2: Proceed with representing 1 as S(0) and 2 as S(S(0)). Then compute 1 + 1 as S(0) + S(0), which by the addition definition equals S(S(0) + 0). Simplify this to S(S(0)) since (S(0) + 0) = S(0).  \n\nStep 3: Continue with establishing the order relation: for natural numbers, a > b if there exists a non-zero c such that a = b + c. Here, compare S(S(0)) (which is 2) and S(0) (which is 1). We have S(S(0)) = S(0) + S(0), so 2 = 1 + 1.  \n\nStep 4: Then demonstrate that 1 + 1 = 2, but to prove inequality, note that 2 > 1 holds since 2 = S(1) and by Peano axioms, the successor of any number is greater than the number itself. Thus, 1 + 1 = 2 > 1.  \n\nStep 5: Finally, conclude that since 2 > 1 and 1 + 1 = 2, transitivity gives 1 + 1 > 1. However, to show 1 + 1 > 2 is false—correcting the initial claim—1 + 1 equals 2, so 1 + 1 ≯ 2.  \n</text>", "error": null}
